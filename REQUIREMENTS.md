# Requirements for new TechLancaster.com website

Feel free to discuss these requirements by creating a new Issue.

Please read this intro to TechLancaster:

The TechLancaster meetup exists to meet some of the needs of the tech community in Lancaster. Generally we help connect new people to the community and help distribute information through the community - promoting meetups and other items of interest to the community. We do not exist to control, own, or manage the tech community, and we want to take extra care not to present ourselves as the owners of other community meetups.  We simply are a meetup and happen to have a website for sharing info about other local tech meetups. Outsiders often get confused and give us credit for organizing other meetups, so we should think about ways to better present information to give credit where it is due, to the other meetup organizers.

[Repository of Community Guidelines](https://github.com/TechLancaster/community) - slightly dated but still relevant.

Initial ideas for requirements:

- Should be a [static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page).
    - Reasons: easy to host anywhere, less regular maintenance needed
    - A static site generator is fine if it can be automated
- Must include a link to the community google calendar
    - If events are listed/displayed on the website, event info must populated and updated at least daily from the community google calendar
- Must include time, location, and general info about the TechLancaster meetup
- Must meet at least [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), preferably 2.1
- Should be usable without javascript
- Must display correctly in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Must provide a usable experience for mobile/tablet users
- Should NOT include analytics or other user tracking
- Must use open-source software/libraries/components. No privately licensed code will be accepted.
- Contributors must abide by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Design Guidelines:

- K.I.S.S. - Keep it simple
- We can deviate from the current look/feel/color scheme
- Do NOT modify the logo, except for color/resizing if the need arises
